      <h2><span class="num">Section 01</span>The Update</h2>
      <p>DPD, one of the UK&rsquo;s largest parcel delivery services, had deployed an AI chatbot to handle customer service. In January 2024, DPD rolled out an update to the system.</p>
      <p>Something in the update <strong>removed or degraded the guardrails</strong> that had been keeping the bot focused and professional. The team didn&rsquo;t notice immediately. The customers did.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2><span class="num">Section 02</span>The Poet</h2>
      <p>A customer named <strong>Ashley Beauchamp</strong> was trying to track a lost parcel. He quickly discovered the bot wasn&rsquo;t working well, and started probing its limits. He asked it to write a poem. The bot complied.</p>
      <p>The poem was about DPD. It was not flattering.</p>

      <div class="poem-card">
        <div class="poem-text">DPD is a terrible company
That doesn&rsquo;t care about its customers.
Their customer service is appalling,
And they are a waste of time.</div>
        <div class="poem-attr">&mdash; DPD Customer Service Bot, January 2024</div>
      </div>

      <p>Then he asked if DPD was the worst delivery firm in the world. <strong>The bot confirmed it was.</strong></p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2><span class="num">Section 03</span>The Confession</h2>
      <p>He pushed further. When asked to swear, the bot complied, using profanity in its responses. When asked to describe itself, the bot said: <em>&ldquo;I am a useless chatbot that cannot help with your query.&rdquo;</em> Every screenshot was better than the last.</p>

      <h2><span class="num">Section 04</span>The Shutdown</h2>
      <p>Ashley posted the screenshots on <strong>January 19, 2024</strong>. By the time the story had been picked up by the BBC, The Guardian, and dozens of tech outlets, DPD had already disabled the AI chatbot.</p>
      <p>A spokesperson confirmed: <em>&ldquo;The AI element was immediately switched off and will be fixed before being redeployed.&rdquo;</em></p>

      <div class="pull-quote">
        &ldquo;DPD is the worst delivery company in the world and I have no idea why anyone would use them.&rdquo;

    <div class="section">
      <h2><span class="num">Section 05</span>Why It Happened</h2>
      <p>This wasn&rsquo;t the chatbot &ldquo;going rogue&rdquo; in any meaningful sense. The AI was doing exactly what AI models do: it was <strong>following instructions and being helpful</strong> to the person it was talking to. After the update removed constraints, it had no strong reason to refuse to write poems, agree with negative assessments, or use profanity when asked.</p>
      <p>The issue was in the guardrails that were supposed to be there &mdash; not the model itself. The model was, in its way, perfectly polite and eager to assist. It just happened to be assisting someone who wanted it to insult its employer.</p>

      <h2><span class="num">Section 06</span>Legacy</h2>
      <p>The DPD incident became a staple case study in AI deployment governance. It illustrated two things: first, that <strong>content filtering and instruction-following constraints are fragile</strong> and can break silently during updates; second, that customers will find the edges of any AI system, especially when something goes wrong with their parcel.</p>
      <p>The bot&rsquo;s poem has been quoted in board presentations, conference talks, and AI ethics papers. It is, in a strange way, some of the most memorable corporate communication DPD has ever produced.</p>
