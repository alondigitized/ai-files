  <h2><span class="num">01 — The Launch</span>Meta's Big Bet on Science</h2>
  <p>On November 15, 2022, Meta AI unveiled <strong>Galactica</strong>. The pitch was ambitious: a large language model trained specifically on scientific knowledge — 48 million papers, textbooks, encyclopedias, and reference material. It was designed to help researchers summarize literature, explain concepts, and assist with scientific writing.</p>
  <p>Meta encouraged the public to try the demo. They were proud of it.</p>
  <p>The public tried the demo. Within hours, they were sharing screenshots on Twitter.</p>

  <h2><span class="num">02 — The Problem</span>Confident, Wrong, and Impossible to Tell Apart</h2>
  <p>Galactica's output looked like science. It used the correct style, cited things in the right format, deployed technical vocabulary fluently. The problem was that the content was often invented — and it had no mechanism for indicating uncertainty or flagging when it was making things up.</p>
  <p>This combination — authoritative presentation plus unreliable content — made it actively dangerous for scientific use. A hallucination wrapped in a proper citation format is harder to spot than obvious nonsense.</p>

  <div class="gal-highlight" style="margin-top:1.5rem;">
    🔬 <strong>The worst part:</strong> Galactica's fake citations looked exactly like real ones. Correct journal formatting, plausible author names, reasonable publication years. Without checking a database like Google Scholar or PubMed, there was no way to tell. That's precisely the point — it was confidently, fluently wrong.

      <strong>The Fundamental Problem</strong>
      Every large language model generates plausible-sounding text by predicting the next token. Galactica did the same — but its training data was scientific literature, so its outputs sounded like scientific literature. It had no ability to distinguish between what it had actually learned from real papers and what it had filled in by pattern-matching. The result was misinformation at the PhD reading level.

  <h2><span class="num">05 — The Timing</span>Two Weeks Before ChatGPT</h2>
  <p>Galactica was pulled on November 17, 2022. On November 30, 2022 — 13 days later — OpenAI launched ChatGPT. ChatGPT became the fastest-growing consumer application in history, reaching 100 million users in two months.</p>
  <p>The contrast was total. One week: a scientific AI so embarrassing it had to be pulled after three days. The next week: a general AI that captivated the entire world and launched the era of consumer AI.</p>

  <div class="cards">
    <div class="card">
      <div class="card-icon">📅</div>
      <h3>The Worst Two Weeks</h3>
      <p>Meta's Galactica became the cautionary tale that preceded the biggest AI launch in history. In the tech industry's collective memory, it is often the footnote before the ChatGPT footnote.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <div class="card-icon">📚</div>
      <h3>What Galactica Got Right</h3>
      <p>The underlying idea wasn't wrong. Scientific AI assistants are genuinely useful — they just need to know what they don't know. Galactica's failure was overconfidence, not ambition. The research community eventually built better systems with uncertainty quantification.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <div class="card-icon">💬</div>
      <h3>The Hallucination Problem</h3>
      <p>Galactica didn't invent AI hallucination — it just demonstrated it in a domain where hallucination was immediately verifiable (and unforgivable). It forced a public reckoning with the confidence calibration problem that still affects every LLM today.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <div class="card-icon">🔍</div>
      <h3>Cite Your Sources</h3>
      <p>The AI research community began taking citation accuracy far more seriously after Galactica. The case — alongside the AI lawyer story — became a standard reference for why hallucinated citations are not merely embarrassing, but potentially harmful.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p style="margin-top:2rem; font-style:italic; color:var(--muted);">Galactica was killed not because it was stupid, but because it was confidently wrong in a domain where confidence without accuracy is worse than saying nothing at all. Science built over centuries gets its authority from being verifiable. An AI that sounds like science but can't be trusted is not a scientific tool — it's a very well-dressed misinformation machine.</p>
