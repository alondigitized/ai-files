  <h2><span class="num">01 — The Case</span>Mata v. Avianca</h2>
  <p>Roberto Mata was suing Avianca airline after claiming he was injured by a metal serving cart during a flight. His attorney at the New York firm Levidow, Levidow &amp; Oberman, <strong>Steven Schwartz</strong>, had practiced law for three decades. He was not a tech skeptic — but he was trying something new.</p>
  <p>To research the case, Schwartz turned to ChatGPT. He asked the AI to help him find prior court cases relevant to Mata's claims. ChatGPT obliged — returning a list of precedents complete with case names, docket numbers, courts, dates, and summaries. They looked exactly like real court citations.</p>
  <p>They were not. All six cases were fabricated.</p>

  <h2><span class="num">02 — The Brief</span>Filed with the Court</h2>
  <p>In May 2023, Schwartz submitted his legal brief in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. Inside, he cited multiple cases to support his client's claims. Among them were entries like these:</p>

  <h2><span class="num">03 — Exhibit A</span>The Cases That Never Were</h2>
  <p>When Avianca's counsel tried to locate the cited precedents, they found nothing. No records. No docket entries. Nothing in any legal database. They notified the court. Judge P. Kevin Castel ordered Schwartz to produce the actual case decisions.</p>
  <p>Schwartz asked ChatGPT to provide them. ChatGPT generated what appeared to be full case decisions — complete, detailed, and entirely invented.</p>

  <h2><span class="num">04 — The Reckoning</span>Judge Castel's Response</h2>
  <p>Judge P. Kevin Castel did not take the filing lightly. He held a hearing. He demanded explanations. Schwartz submitted an affidavit explaining that he had used ChatGPT without understanding that it could fabricate citations, and that he had verified the cases — by asking ChatGPT to confirm they were real. ChatGPT had assured him they were.</p>

      <strong>From Schwartz's Affidavit</strong>
      "I did not understand that ChatGPT could fabricate cases. I asked the program whether the cases were real. ChatGPT told me that the cases were real." When the judge asked Schwartz whether he had done any independent verification in a legal database, the answer was no.

  <h2><span class="num">05 — The Fallout</span>How Law Changed After Mata v. Avianca</h2>
  <p>The Schwartz case arrived at a pivotal moment — when AI tools were first becoming easily accessible to legal professionals, but before any clear ethical guidance existed. It forced the profession to confront AI directly.</p>

  <div class="cards">
    <div class="card">
      <div class="card-icon">📜</div>
      <h3>Court AI Disclosure Rules</h3>
      <p>Multiple federal courts issued new local rules requiring lawyers to certify that any AI-generated content has been independently verified, or to disclose AI's use in drafting filings.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <div class="card-icon">🏛️</div>
      <h3>Bar Association Guidance</h3>
      <p>State bar associations across the US issued ethics opinions warning that the duty of competence includes understanding the limitations of AI tools — including their tendency to hallucinate.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <div class="card-icon">🔍</div>
      <h3>Verification Obligation</h3>
      <p>The case established a clear professional standard: using AI for legal research is not inherently unethical, but failing to independently verify citations in a legal database is.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <div class="card-icon">🎓</div>
      <h3>Law School Curriculum</h3>
      <p>Mata v. Avianca became case study material in law schools teaching AI literacy — the canonical example of what happens when lawyers trust AI outputs without verification.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p style="margin-top:2rem; font-style:italic; color:var(--muted);">ChatGPT didn't set out to deceive Schwartz. It was doing exactly what it was designed to do: generating fluent, plausible-sounding text. It just had no mechanism to distinguish a real case from a convincing invention. That distinction was supposed to be the lawyer's job.</p>
